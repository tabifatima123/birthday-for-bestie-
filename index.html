      <p>Happy Birthday, my strong baby â€” my one and only Sonny. ðŸ’– Every year when this day comes, I find myself smiling a little extra, because itâ€™s the day the world was gifted with you.</p>
      <p>Youâ€™re not just my best friend â€” youâ€™re my calm and my chaos, my laughter and my peace, my person through every mood swing, every late-night talk, and every moment that life threw at us.</p>
      <p>Youâ€™ve seen my messy hair, my ugliest cry, and my loudest laugh â€” and somehow, you stayed, always with that same soft smile and those eyes that could melt any storm away.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve always loved how strong you are, even when you donâ€™t realize it. You carry the world on your shoulders and still manage to make everyone around you feel lighter.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I think about how lucky I am â€” to have found someone who gets me without words, who can read my silence, who knows exactly when to pull me out of my overthinking and when to just sit beside me in it. Youâ€™re my home in human form, Sara.</p>
      <p>Today, I just want to remind you: You are so loved. You are so precious. And you deserve every bit of happiness the universe can give.</p>
      <p>Keep being the strong, crazy, beautiful soul that you are â€” my Sonny, my forever favorite human. ðŸ’«</p>
      <p>Always with you â€” in laughter, in memories, and in every song that reminds me of you. ðŸ’–</p>
